<h3> Job Search Update </h3>

<p>So you asked Srini about update about his job search or something similar. Here is the answer - He is still unemployed and is still "actively" interiewing.</p>

<p> If you want any more information than that, ask yourself "Why do I want to ask more?" It can be any of the below</p>

<ol>
<p><li>"I care about Srini's well being. I think without a job he would be miserable. So I want to know how long before his misery ends."</li>Good on you for caring. But Srini doesn't know when he will land a job TILL he lands a job. So even if he is in the last rounds for 100 companies, as long he doesn't clear it, he is still in unemployed state. So the original answer is still applicable.</p>
<p><li>"I think I may know of openings in my company or I heard XYZ company is hiring."</li>Great! Ask Srini directly that you heard XYZ company is hiring and who can refer him. Srini will promptly give you the resume. And most importantly, he will be very grateful for your help!</p>
<p><li>"I myself am looking for opportunities and would benefit from Srini's current interviewing experience."</li>Great! Tell Srini directly just that. He will be more than happy to tell you everything he knows. Just stop him if he is helping too much!</p>
<p><li>"I figure Job Search is one of the biggest thing for Srini right now, so it makes sense to ask about it."</li>You are god damn right. It is the biggest thing for him right now. But Srini does not find any value in narrating his every single interview experience, since all of them are his failed attempts and everything he says would appear as if he is venting. Which he will be, but he doesn't want to. Venting does not help Srini unless there is a (previously unthought) growth area he can identify while venting to you. </p>
<p><li>"But I can provide him some tips if I know where he is going wrong. So it is not necessarily waste for him to tell his job search experience"</li>Good thinking. Srini really appreciates you trying to help. Tell him directly that you feel you have experience in looking for a software development job and you can specifically help Srini improve. Srini will be very grateful!</p>
<p><li>"If not about the most important thing in his life right now, what else should we be talking about?"</li> A lot of other things! What's the last exciting thing you did? Ask him about how universe tells jokes</p>
<p><li>"Something else. It's not in the above list" Wow that's interesting, tell Srini ASAP.</p></li>
</ol>

<p> Sorry for the third person talk. If I have shared this link with you, it's because I care about you caring about me. And I deeply respect you. I hope I did not offend you. </p>
